# Bulletproof Node.js architecture üõ°Ô∏è

This is the example repository from the blog post ['Bulletproof node.js project architecture'](https://softwareontheroad.com/ideal-nodejs-project-structure?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme)

Please read the blog post in order to have a good understanding of the server architecture.

Also, I added lots of comments to the code that are not in the blog post, because they explain the implementation and the reason behind the choices of libraries and some personal opinions and some bad jokes.

The API by itself doesn't do anything fancy, it's just a user CRUD with authentication capabilities.
Maybe we can transform this into something useful, a more advanced example, just open an issue and let's discuss the future of the repo.

## Development

The first time, you will need to run

```
npm install
```

Start the server with 

```
npm run dev
```
It uses nodemon for livereloading

# API Validation
 
  By using celebrate the req.body schema becomes clary defined at route level, so even frontend devs can read what an API endpoint expects without need to writting a documentation that can get outdated quickly.

  ```js
  route.post('/signup', 
    celebrate({
      body: Joi.object({
        name: Joi.string().required(),
        email: Joi.string().required(),
        password: Joi.string().required(),
      }),
    }),
    controller.signup)
    ```

    **Example error**

    ```json
    {
      "errors": {
        "message": "child \"email\" fails because [\"email\" is required]"
      }
    } 
  ```
